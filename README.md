This is the README for the final project for INFO 201. Collaboration partners include Kihoon Lee, SangHo Bak, Yao Dou,and Jeffrey Jing.
Our final product will be in the form of an interactive Shiny based application. For this project, we intend to utilize publicly available data on the stock market's S&P 500 in order to allow users who love stock and want to analysis stock data to compare how well companies have been doing financially over the past 11 years(2017-01-03 to now ) and see the historical data of S&P 500 companies' stocks.

Besides, we also use R package prophet to predict stock in a period. You can use it in the third tabpanel of [Shiny App](https://douy.shinyapps.io/AmazingStockApp2/).

The data is gotten from the R package [quantmod](https://www.quantmod.com).

For those who don't know, the S&P 500 includes 500 of the stock market's top 500 companies.
